## Welcome to Local Apache Hadoop and hive setup using VWware playstation and Headless centos OS.

Many of us are using windows as our laptop OS , trust me Hadoop and hive binaries are still not compatible with windows OS.
Idea behind this repo is to setup a local hadoop setup to debug or run your local spark/mapreduce code locally and debug them if required.
In this page I am going to show you how I have setup a single node hadoop cluster from scratch , also we will see how can we easily extend our single node hadoop setup to
multiple node clusters. Currently I am running 4 node hadoop cluster in my Local.
